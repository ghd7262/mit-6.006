**Asymptotic Analysis**: of an algorithm refers to defining the mathematical framing of its run-time performance. using asymptotic analysis, we can very well conclude the best case, average case and worst case scenario of an algorithm.

> Measuring performance of an algorithm in terms of run-time.

**Asymptotic Computational Complexity**: is the usage of asymptotic analysis for the estimation of computational complexity of algorithms and computational problems, commonly associated with the usage of big-o-notation.

**Asymptotic Time Complexity**: The limiting behavior of the execution time of an algorithm when size of the problem goes to infinity.
